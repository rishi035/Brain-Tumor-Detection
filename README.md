# Brain-Tumor-Detection
I will document the entire process of building a brain tumor detection model, including the steps, challenges, and improvements made along the way.

**Attempt One :**

This is my first attempt at building a multi-class brain tumor classification model using TensorFlow's ResNet. Since a validation set was not provided, I split the training data into training and validation sets. Initially, I tested the model on a small subset of 200 images. Afterward, I trained the full model on the complete dataset and evaluated it using the test data. While the training accuracy reached 94%, the overall accuracy was low. I plan to analyze the pipeline, identify mistakes, and make improvements in the next iteration.
I will upload next iteration within 1 0r 2 days thank you.

**Attempt Two:**
I will upload within two days
